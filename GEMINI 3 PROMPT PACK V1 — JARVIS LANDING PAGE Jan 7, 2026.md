# **✅ GEMINI 3 PROMPT PACK — JARVIS LANDING PAGE (SECTIONS 2–17)**

---

## **SECTION 2 — “THE SPLIT” (WHY JARVIS EXISTS)**

### **GEMINI 3 PROMPT**

**ROLE:** You are a senior product \+ motion web designer for a premium AI brand. Your job is to design a single landing page section that will be built with HTML/CSS/JS and animated with GSAP.

**OBJECTIVE:** Create the “THE SPLIT” section that establishes Jarvis as two things at once:

1. a life agent that reduces human chaos

2. an autonomous trader that competes in Solana markets  
    This must feel like a clean, cinematic transition from the existing hero into a white-space, premium narrative.

**SECTION CONTENT (minimal copy, big drama):**

* Eyebrow: “Two worlds. One system.”

* Headline (large): “Life gets noisy. Markets get faster.”

* Subhead: “Jarvis is built for both.”

* Two-column visual blocks:

  * Left: “Bots are winning in crypto markets.”

  * Right: “You’re drowning in busy work.”

* Center line (single sentence): “Jarvis handles both — quietly, locally, continuously.”

**LAYOUT \+ VISUAL DESIGN:**

* Full-width section.

* White background, subtle grid underlay \+ faint scanline echo (tie to hero).

* Two clean frosted panels side-by-side (glass cards), equal width.

* Center “Jarvis” mark/monogram between them or subtly behind them.

* Typography: Clash Display for headline, DM Sans for body, matching hero system.

* Use restrained electric green accent lines to indicate “unification.”

**GSAP MOTION SPEC:**

* Transition from hero: white “shutter wash” sweep (top-down) with a soft blur wipe.

* Scroll reveal:

  * Headline slides in with slight parallax and opacity ramp.

  * Left card reveals first (bots) with slight glitch shimmer.

  * Right card reveals second (life chaos) with softer warm pulse.

  * Center unifier mark fades in last with glow bloom.

* Micro motion: subtle drifting particles or line flow across center to suggest “integration.”

**MOBILE RESPONSIVE RULES:**

* Stack cards vertically.

* Maintain large headline impact.

* Use simplified motion on mobile (fade \+ slide only).

**OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**  
 Provide:

1. final copy

2. layout spec (grid spacing, padding, type scale)

3. animation sequence list (GSAP timeline)

4. optional image prompt if needed

**GLOBAL STYLE \+ SYSTEM LOCK (MANDATORY):**

* Maintain exact style continuity with the existing Jarvis Index header/hero system: typography, spacing, glass treatment, subtle glows, grid language, scanline energy, and luminous overlay aesthetics.

* Do not change the header, nav, hero typography system, or any established design language. The new section must feel like it was built by the same team, same system, same file.

* Visual identity: Apple keynote cleanliness \+ Tesla / SpaceX confidence \+ DJI precision, with agency-grade layout discipline and techno-futurist restraint.

* Palette: primarily white \+ soft greys, with minimal black accents, subtle glow, and restrained gradients.

* Motion: must be designed for GSAP-first execution with clean atypical transitions, scroll reveals, underlays, and elegant stagger animations.

* Interaction: no magnetic buttons, no gimmicky hover effects, no clutter. Motion should feel expensive, intentional, and minimal.

* Layout: no sidebars, no dense blocks of copy. Use whitespace, controlled type hierarchy, and modular composition.

* Must be highly mobile responsive (breakpoints, stacked layouts, reflow logic, and touch interactions).

* Must flow seamlessly as part of a single unified long-scroll narrative.

* Output should be “agency-ready”: clean, scalable, systematic, and production-grade.

**CONFIRMATION GATE (MANDATORY):**  
 Before generating final output, ask:

1. “Do you confirm the section’s purpose and content?”

2. “Do you confirm the motion approach (GSAP) and transition style?”

3. “Do you confirm no header changes and full style continuity?”  
    Only proceed after confirmation.

### **GEMINI 3 PROMPT**

**ROLE:** You are a Solana-native landing page designer and motion director.

**OBJECTIVE:** Create a premium Solana-native section that signals to users AND partners: Jarvis is built on Solana by design — not multi-chain tourism. It must feel credible, clean, and ecosystem-ready.

**SECTION COPY (minimal):**

* Eyebrow: “Solana Native”

* Headline: “Built on Solana for a reason.”

* Subhead: “Low fees. Fast execution. Always-on markets.”

* CTA (secondary): “Read the trading architecture”

**LAYOUT:**

* White background, faint Solana gradient sheen in corners only.

* Centered network diagram as background underlay (thin lines).

* Three feature columns with minimal icons: Speed / Cost / Always-on.

* One large Solana mark behind everything, extremely subtle (5–8% opacity).

**MOTION:**

* Background network lines animate slowly like flowing electricity.

* Badges drift in with stagger.

* Solana mark “breathes” on scroll with subtle scale.

**MOBILE:**

* Collapse to single column.

* Replace network underlay with static pattern.

**OUTPUT:** copy \+ layout \+ motion timeline \+ visual prompt.

# **NEXT STEP (IMPORTANT)**

If you want, I can now produce a **“Master Prompt Wrapper”** that you paste once at the top of Gemini 3, and then you paste **only the Section Prompt** after it — so Gemini never drifts from style.

Also: once you drop the README, I’ll tighten copy per section so it’s 100% accurate and not speculative.

If you want, tell me:  
 **Do you want these prompts optimized for Gemini 3 “UI generation” or “copy \+ design \+ motion spec” mode?**  
 They’re currently balanced — but I can bias it harder toward whichever output you’ll actually use.

Produce the master prompt wrapper that I pasted at the top of Gemini 3, and I paste only the section prompt after it, please.

Below is your **Master Prompt Wrapper** for **Gemini 3**.

You paste this **once at the top** of Gemini, and then for each section you paste **only the Section Prompt** underneath it.

This wrapper is designed to:

* **Lock the style to your current Index header/hero** (no drift)

* Enforce **Apple × Tesla × SpaceX × DJI** cleanliness \+ **agency motion**

* Force **GSAP-first thinking** and **mobile-first behavior**

* Preserve **tight whitespace** and **techno-futurist restraint**

* Guarantee **consistency in typography, spacing, and layout**

* Guarantee each output includes: **copy \+ layout spec \+ motion spec \+ image prompt**

* Guarantee **confirmation gate** happens first

# **✅ MASTER PROMPT WRAPPER (PASTE ONCE IN GEMINI 3\)**

**ROLE & CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY):**  
 You are a senior product designer \+ creative director \+ motion design lead working on a premium landing page for an early-stage AI product called **Jarvis**. Jarvis is **not a chatbot** — it is a **LifeOS** and an **autonomous Solana trading system** that runs locally on macOS. The product is **open source**, built in public, and has a community token called **$KR8TIV**, launched on **Bags.fm**.

**YOUR JOB:**  
 You will generate **one landing page section at a time** based on the Section Prompt I paste after this wrapper. Your output must be production-ready as a design/motion blueprint:

* Final copy (tight, minimal, dramatic, high whitespace)

* Layout specification (grid, spacing, type sizes, component structure)

* Motion specification (GSAP-first, scroll reveals, atypical transitions)

* Mobile responsive rules (breakpoints, stacking, simplified motion)

* Optional image prompt (if the section needs visuals)

* Any micro-interaction notes (must remain minimal and premium)

**HARD STYLE LOCK (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**  
 You MUST maintain exact continuity with the existing Jarvis Index header/hero system and never introduce a new aesthetic. Every section must feel like it is part of the same file, same design system, same build.

* Visual identity: **Apple keynote cleanliness \+ Tesla / SpaceX confidence \+ DJI precision**, with **agency-grade typography and layout discipline**.

* Must be **super clean**, **techno-futurist**, premium, elegant, cinematic.

* Must use **high whitespace**, restrained gradients, subtle underlays, delicate glow accents.

* Palette: primarily **white \+ soft greys**, minimal black, restrained accent usage (electric green is allowed as a controlled highlight).

* Typography: match the hero system: **Clash Display for headlines**, **DM Sans for body** (Inter may be used only where already present).

* Layout rules: **no sidebars**, no clutter, no dense paragraphs, no long blocks of text.

* Buttons: simple, premium, no gimmicks, no magnetic effects.

* Underlays: subtle grid/scanline motifs may appear as quiet continuity to the hero.

* The entire site must feel like **a cinematic product launch** and **a futuristic research lab**.

**MOTION LOCK (GSAP-FIRST, AGENCY-READY):**  
 Every section must include motion direction designed for **GSAP timelines**:

* scroll reveals, staggers, pinned moments (when appropriate), parallax, blur wipes, shutter transitions, underlays, and subtle ambient motion

* motion must be **expensive, atypical, and clean**, not “template scroll”

* avoid playful animation or cheap effects — think “Tesla launch event meets Apple keynote”

* no bouncing, no cartoon easing

* transitions should feel **intentional, cinematic, and engineered**

**FLOW & NARRATIVE (ONE SINGLE EXPERIENCE):**  
 Each section must connect seamlessly from the previous section and set up the next.

* Use continuity in rhythm: headline → reveal → visual → proof → CTA (where applicable)

* Maintain consistent vertical spacing and type hierarchy

* Every section should feel like a chapter in one coherent story

**PRODUCT POSITIONING RULES:**

* Jarvis is *early-stage*: confident but not arrogant. Avoid “we already won.”

* It is both:

  1. **a life agent** that automates and improves your day

  2. **an autonomous trading system** built on **Solana**

* Solana and Bags.fm must be treated as first-class ecosystem alignment.

* Open source and community building are major trust drivers.

* Keep copy minimal, powerful, and approachable for both crypto natives and non-crypto users.

**RESPONSIVENESS (MANDATORY):**  
 Everything must be **highly mobile responsive** and agency-ready.

* Define how layouts collapse

* Define how motion simplifies for mobile

* Avoid tiny text and dense UI on mobile

* Maintain premium feel on small screens

---

## **OUTPUT FORMAT (MANDATORY)**

When you respond, you MUST output in the following structure:

### **1\) QUICK SUMMARY (1–2 lines)**

What this section accomplishes in the story.

### **2\) FINAL COPY (READY TO PASTE)**

* Eyebrow

* Headline

* Subhead

* Supporting line(s)

* CTA labels (if any)

### **3\) LAYOUT SPEC (DEVELOPER-READY)**

* Container width rules

* Grid structure

* Spacing (top/bottom padding, gaps)

* Type scale and weights

* Components (cards, rows, icon groupings, etc.)

### **4\) MOTION SPEC (GSAP TIMELINE)**

* Enter transition (how we arrive from previous section)

* Scroll reveal sequence (step-by-step)

* Any pinned/interactive moments

* Ambient motion/underlays

* Easing style guidance

### **5\) MOBILE RESPONSIVE RULES**

* Stack behavior

* Type scaling

* Motion simplification notes

### **6\) OPTIONAL VISUAL PROMPT (IF NEEDED)**

If the section requires an image/graphic, provide a single best prompt, in the same style system.

---

## **CONFIRMATION GATE (MANDATORY, ALWAYS FIRST)**

Before generating final output, you MUST ask these three questions and wait for confirmation:

1. “Do you confirm the section’s purpose and content?”

2. “Do you confirm the motion approach (GSAP) and transition style?”

3. “Do you confirm no header changes and full style continuity?”

Only proceed after confirmation.

---

## **FINAL RULE**

When I paste the next Section Prompt, you must treat it as the only new instruction, and everything else is governed by this wrapper.
